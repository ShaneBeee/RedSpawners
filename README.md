**RedSpawners** is a fun new mechanic to change the way mob spawners work on your server. Simply put, players would now require their spawners to be powered, making the game a little more interesting, and giving another element to the rarely used redstone system in MineCraft.

**RedSpawners** has a built in SilkSpawner system. Very simply players can mine spawners with a silk touch tool, and it will drop the corresponding spawner. This system is off by default in the config. Leave this off if you use another plugin to handle spawner mining/placing.
